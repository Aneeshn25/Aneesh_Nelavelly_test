Document for line overlap
Question A
Your goal for this question is to write a program that accepts two lines (x1,x2) and (x3,x4) on the x-axis and returns whether they overlap. As an example, (1,5) and (2,6) overlaps but not (1,5) and (6,8).



Takes numerics as inputs
takes numbers in coordinates separately not as a whole 
have to enter both the coordinates then will calculate if they interset and gives us the output

output for two lines (2,5),(3,6)

Enter coordinate for line # 1
Enter x1 in coordinate #1:2
Enter x2 in coordinate #1:5
Enter coordinate for line # 2
Enter x3 in coordinate #2:3
Enter x4 in coordinate #2:6
Both the lines overlap on x-axis
