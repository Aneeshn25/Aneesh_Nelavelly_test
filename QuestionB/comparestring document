document for compare strings

The goal of this question is to write a software library that accepts 2 version string as input and returns whether one is greater than, equal, or less than the other. As an example: �1.2� is greater than �1.1�. Please provide all test cases you could think of.


takes string as an input

then it will check if it is float then only program proceedes or will asks user to try again
then it will do comparision and shows user the output

test case

Please only numbers are allowed!
 Enter a value one: 2
 Enter a value two: 1
2.0  is grater than  1.0

Want to try again(y/n):n
