Question C
At Ormuco, we want to optimize every bits of software we write. Your goal is to write a new library that can be integrated to the Ormuco stack. Dealing with network issues everyday, latency is our biggest problem. Thus, your challenge is to write a new Geo Distributed LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with time expiration. This library will be used extensively by many of our services so it needs to meet the following criteria:


gives a menu to select from 

program will ask user to select from menu 

enter the data as you need but only takes until size 5, so as you user is keep entering the data after he entered 5 already the first in data will get popped out

then user can also access the data as the data being accessed it will take the first position with its current position (swaps with the one on top)

Finally data gets expiered in 30 secons of that is not being accessed in 30 seconds (we can change time if we want)



missing fuctionality:

1 - Resilient to network failures or crashes.
2 - Near real time replication of data across Geolocation. Writes need to be in real time.
3 - Data consistency across regions
4 - Locality of reference, d
